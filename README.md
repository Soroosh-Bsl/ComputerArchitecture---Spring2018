# ComputerArchitecture---Spring2018
The Computer Architecture course @ Sharif University of Technology ---Spring2018


HW1: Ripple Carry Adder & Carry Select Adder implemented using Quartus.

HW2: Q3 & Q4-> MIPS assembly language programming questions (Fibonacci calculator and prime number detector).
     Q6 & Q7-> Address translator for a bank of registers + an ALU implemented in Quartus.
     
HW3: A complete StackMachine CPU was implemented in Quartus. Except for the ALU and the mempry unit all other part were implemented using Quartus Schematic. 

HW4: A more completed CPU, this time using microprogramming, was implemented in Quartus Schematic.

HW5: A cache simulator written in python was used to analyze differnt sorting algorithms costs. Various parameters for cache memory for BubbleSort, MergeSort, QuickSort, and InsertionSort were used.

Project: A simplified JVM emulator implemented in Python.
